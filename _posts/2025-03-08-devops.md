# Building a Complete DevOps Pipeline in My Homelab - with Terraform, Ansible

After setting up my initial Proxmox cluster (which I wrote about in my [previous post](https://blog.joshdefreitas.info/posts/home-lab/)), I wanted to take my homelab to the next level by implementing a full DevOps pipeline. This project has been incredible for learning industry-standard tools and practices in a controlled environment. I'll walk you through how I set up a complete CI/CD pipeline with infrastructure as code, configuration management, containerization, and monitoring.

## Architecture Overview

My DevOps homelab consists of a four-VM setup running on my Proxmox cluster. Here's the architecture I implemented:

![DevOps Architecture](https://imgur.com/bclKSLD)

**Infrastructure:**

- **Proxmox** Hypervisor running on my Dell OptiPlex and laptop nodes
  - **VM1**: Jenkins Server (CI/CD) - 4GB RAM, 2 vCPUs, 50GB storage
  - **VM2**: Application VM (Dev Environment) - 2GB RAM, 1 vCPU, 30GB storage
  - **VM3**: Application VM (Production Environment) - 2GB RAM, 1 vCPU, 30GB storage
  - **VM4**: Prometheus + Grafana Monitoring - 4GB RAM, 2 vCPUs, 40GB storage

**Networking:**

- All VMs on a private subnet (192.168.100.0/24)
- Jenkins server with SSH access to other VMs via private key authentication
- Prometheus/Grafana VM with access to monitor metrics from all other VMs

## 0. Getting Started

### Jenkins
In Proxmox, I deployed an Ubuntu server LXC with the resources mentioned above. I installed docker and followed the official [Jenkins documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/docker/). First downloaded and ran the Docker-in-Docker(dind) image and configured it to a docker network. I then created a custom Docker image which would install Jenkins and Docker CLI, as well as blueocean. After building and running both containers. I configured Jenkins to connect to my Github. I chose this set up as Jenkins will be able to deploy agents using dind which offers flexibility when executing jobs.

Here is how I set up my Jenkinsfile to execute terraform with Jenkins:

```
#Jenkinsfile
pipeline {
    agent {
        dockerfile {
            filename 'Dockerfile.agent'
            additionalBuildArgs '--no-cache'
            reuseNode true    
            args '-v /tmp:/tmp'
        }
    }
    
    parameters {
        string(name: 'PROXMOX_HOST', defaultValue: '192.168.1.10', description: 'Proxmox host IP address')
        string(name: 'VM_NAME', defaultValue: 'test-vm', description: 'Name for the new VM')
        string(name: 'VM_IP', defaultValue: '192.168.1.11', description: 'IP address for the new VM')
    }
    
    environment {
        PROXMOX_API_TOKEN_ID = credentials('proxmox-token-id')
        PROXMOX_API_TOKEN_SECRET = credentials('proxmox-token-secret')
        SSH_PUBLIC_KEY = credentials('homelab-ssh-public-key')
        TF_LOG = 'DEBUG'
        TF_LOG_PATH = 'terraform-debug.log'
    }
    
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                checkout scm
            }
        }
        
        stage('Test Connectivity') {
            steps {
                sh '''
                echo "Testing connectivity to Proxmox..."
                ping -c 3 ''' + params.PROXMOX_HOST + ''' || echo "Ping failed but continuing"
                
                echo "Testing API access..."
                curl -k -s -o /dev/null -w "Proxmox API HTTP Status: %{http_code}\\n" https://''' + params.PROXMOX_HOST + ''':8006/ || echo "API check failed but continuing"
                '''
            }
        }
        
        stage('Terraform Init') {
            steps {
                dir('terraform') {
                    sh 'terraform init -upgrade'
                }
            }
        }
        
        stage('Terraform Plan') {
            steps {
                dir('terraform') {
                    sh """

                }
            }
        }
        
        stage('Terraform Apply') {
            steps {
                dir('terraform') {
                    sh 'terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan'
                }
            }
        }
        
        stage('Verify VM Creation') {
            steps {
                dir('terraform') {
                    sh 'terraform output'
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    post { 
        always {
            echo "Cleaning up workspace..."
            
            // Clean up Terraform files inside the container
            sh '''
                # Print disk usage

                    rm -f terraform.tfstate.backup tfplan
                    cd ..
                fi
                
                # Clean workspace
                rm -rf .terraform
            '''
            
            cleanWs notFailBuild: true

            echo "VM creation successful! VM '${params.VM_NAME}' has been created with IP ${params.VM_IP}" 
        } 
        failure { 
            echo "VM creation failed. Check the logs for details." 
        } 

    }    
}
```

## 1. Setting Up the Infrastructure with Terraform

First, I needed to provision the virtual machines. While Proxmox has a great UI, I wanted to practice Infrastructure as Code, so I used Terraform with the Proxmox provider.

Here's how I created the Terraform configuration:

```hcl
# main.tf
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.1.0"
  required_providers {
    proxmox = {
      source  = "telmate/proxmox"
      version = "3.0.1-rc3"
    }
  }
}

provider "proxmox" {
  pm_tls_insecure = true
  pm_api_url = var.proxmox_api_url
  pm_api_token_id = var.proxmox_api_token_id
  pm_api_token_secret = var.proxmox_api_token_secret
}

resource "proxmox_vm_qemu" "test_vm" {
  name        = var.vm_name
  desc        = "VM created via Terraform"
  target_node = var.proxmox_node
  
  # Clone from template
  clone       = var.template_name
  
  # VM settings
  agent                  = 1
  automatic_reboot       = true
  balloon                = 0
  bios                   = "seabios"
  boot                   = "order=scsi0;net0"
  cores                  = 2
  define_connection_info = true
  force_create           = false
  hotplug                = "network,disk,usb"
  memory                 = 2048
  numa                   = false
  onboot                 = false
  scsihw                 = "virtio-scsi-pci"
  sockets                = 1
  
  # Disk configuration - using disks block instead of disk
  disks {
    scsi {
      scsi0 {
        disk {
          backup   = true
          cache    = "none"
          discard  = true
          iothread = true
          size     = "20G"
          storage  = "local-lvm"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  # Network configuration
  network {
    bridge   = "vmbr0"
    model    = "virtio"
    firewall = false
  }
  
  # Cloud-init settings
  os_type    = "cloud-init"
  ipconfig0  = "ip=${var.vm_ip}/24,gw=${var.gateway}"
  sshkeys    = var.ssh_public_key
}

# Additional resources for other VMs...
```

I ran `terraform apply` and watched as my VMs were automatically provisioned on my Proxmox cluster. This approach allowed me to version control my infrastructure and make changes in a controlled manner.

## 2. Configuring Servers with Ansible

With the VMs provisioned, I needed to configure them. Ansible made this process straightforward and repeatable. I created an Ansible playbook structure with roles for each component:

```
ansible/
├── inventory.yml
├── site.yml
└── roles/
    ├── common/
    ├── jenkins/
    ├── app_server/
    └── monitoring/
```

My inventory file looked like this:

```yaml
# inventory.yml
all:
  children:
    jenkins:
      hosts:
        jenkins-server:
          ansible_host: 192.168.100.10
    dev:
      hosts:
        dev-server:
          ansible_host: 192.168.100.20
    prod:
      hosts:
        prod-server:
          ansible_host: 192.168.100.30
    monitoring:
      hosts:
        monitoring-server:
          ansible_host: 192.168.100.40
  vars:
    ansible_user: ubuntu
    ansible_ssh_private_key_file: ~/.ssh/homelab_key
```

I then ran the playbook to configure all servers:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml site.yml
```

The Jenkins role installed and configured Jenkins with the necessary plugins, while the app server roles set up the environments for my application, including Node.js, Docker, and other dependencies.

## 3. Building a Simple Node.js Application

For this project, I developed a basic Node.js API that serves weather data. It's simple but has enough complexity to demonstrate the CI/CD pipeline. The app uses Express.js and connects to a MongoDB database to store and retrieve weather records.

```javascript
// app.js
const express = require("express");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Connect to MongoDB
mongoose.connect(
  process.env.MONGODB_URI || "mongodb://localhost:27017/weatherdb"
);

// Define Weather schema
const weatherSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  location: String,
  temperature: Number,
  conditions: String,
  timestamp: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
});

const Weather = mongoose.model("Weather", weatherSchema);

// Routes
app.use(express.json());

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: "Weather API is running" });
});

app.get("/weather/:location", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const weather = await Weather.findOne({
      location: req.params.location
    }).sort({ timestamp: -1 });

    if (!weather) {
      return res.status(404).json({ error: "Weather data not found" });
    }

    res.json(weather);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: err.message });
  }
});

// Start server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});
```

I included unit tests using Jest and integration tests to verify the API endpoints functioned correctly.

## 4. Dockerizing the Application

To ensure consistent deployments across environments, I containerized my application using Docker:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

And created a docker-compose.yml file to define the application stack:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3"
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - MONGODB_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/weatherdb
    depends_on:
      - mongo

  mongo:
    image: mongo:6
    volumes:
      - mongo-data:/data/db
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"

volumes:
  mongo-data:
```

## 5. Setting Up CI/CD with Jenkins

This was the most exciting part - creating an automated pipeline to build, test, and deploy my application. I created a Jenkinsfile in my repository:

```groovy
// Jenkinsfile
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        DOCKER_HUB_CREDS = credentials('docker-hub-credentials')
        APP_IMAGE = 'joshdev/weather-api'
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                checkout scm
            }
        }

        stage('Install Dependencies') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm ci'
            }
        }

        stage('Lint') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm run lint'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm test'
            }
        }

        stage('Build Docker Image') {
            steps {
                sh "docker build -t ${APP_IMAGE}:${BUILD_NUMBER} ."
                sh "docker tag ${APP_IMAGE}:${BUILD_NUMBER} ${APP_IMAGE}:latest"
            }
        }

        stage('Push Docker Image') {
            steps {
                sh "echo ${DOCKER_HUB_CREDS_PSW} | docker login -u ${DOCKER_HUB_CREDS_USR} --password-stdin"
                sh "docker push ${APP_IMAGE}:${BUILD_NUMBER}"
                sh "docker push ${APP_IMAGE}:latest"
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy to Dev') {
            steps {
                sh "ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory.yml ansible/deploy.yml --limit dev -e 'app_version=${BUILD_NUMBER}'"
            }
        }

        stage('Integration Tests') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm run test:integration'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy to Production') {
            when {
                branch 'main'
            }
            steps {
                sh "ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory.yml ansible/deploy.yml --limit prod -e 'app_version=${BUILD_NUMBER}'"
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            sh 'docker logout'
            sh 'npm run clean'
        }
    }
}
```

For deployment, I created an Ansible playbook (deploy.yml) that pulls the Docker image and starts the containers:

```yaml
# ansible/deploy.yml
---
- name: Deploy Weather API
  hosts: "{{ limit | default('dev') }}"
  become: yes
  vars:
    app_version: latest

  tasks:
    - name: Create app directory
      file:
        path: /opt/weather-api
        state: directory
        mode: "0755"

    - name: Copy docker-compose file
      template:
        src: templates/docker-compose.j2
        dest: /opt/weather-api/docker-compose.yml

    - name: Pull latest images
      community.docker.docker_compose:
        project_src: /opt/weather-api
        pull: yes

    - name: Start containers
      community.docker.docker_compose:
        project_src: /opt/weather-api
        state: present
```

## 6. Setting Up Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

To monitor the health and performance of my application and infrastructure, I configured Prometheus to scrape metrics from all VMs and the Node.js application (using the prom-client library).

I created a Prometheus configuration file:

```yaml
# prometheus.yml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "jenkins"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["192.168.100.10:9100"] # Node exporter on Jenkins

  - job_name: "dev_server"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["192.168.100.20:9100"] # Node exporter on Dev
      - targets: ["192.168.100.20:3000"] # Weather API metrics endpoint

  - job_name: "prod_server"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["192.168.100.30:9100"] # Node exporter on Prod
      - targets: ["192.168.100.30:3000"] # Weather API metrics endpoint
```

In Grafana, I created dashboards to visualize:

- System metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage)
- Application metrics (request count, response times, error rates)
- Jenkins build metrics (success/failure rates, build duration)

## Challenges and Lessons Learned

This project wasn't without its challenges. Here are some issues I encountered and how I resolved them:

1. **Resource Constraints**: My homelab has limited resources, so I had to optimize VM resource allocation to prevent overloading my Proxmox nodes. I ended up reducing the VM resources initially allocated and implementing CPU/memory limits.

2. **Networking Issues**: Initially, I struggled with VM connectivity in my private subnet. The solution was to correctly configure the bridges in Proxmox and ensure the network settings in Terraform matched my physical network.

3. **Jenkins Pipeline Debugging**: The Jenkins pipeline failed initially due to missing dependencies and permissions. I had to update the Ansible roles to ensure all required packages were installed and proper permissions were set.

4. **Monitoring Setup**: Getting Prometheus to properly scrape all endpoints took some trial and error, particularly in configuring the Node.js application to expose metrics in the right format.

## Next Steps

This DevOps homelab has been an incredible learning experience, but I'm not stopping here. My next plans include:

1. **Implementing GitOps with ArgoCD**: Moving from Jenkins to a GitOps approach for even more declarative deployments.

2. **Adding Kubernetes**: Replacing individual VMs with a Kubernetes cluster for better scalability and resource utilization.

3. **Enhancing Security**: Implementing Vault for secrets management and enhancing overall security practices.

4. **Expanding Monitoring**: Adding ELK stack for centralized logging alongside Prometheus/Grafana for metrics.

## Conclusion

Building this DevOps pipeline in my homelab has been invaluable for my professional growth. It's one thing to read about DevOps practices, but actually implementing them in a working environment provides a much deeper understanding.

The most valuable lesson I've learned is how these tools work together to create a seamless pipeline from code to production. Each component has its specific role, but the real power comes from their integration into a cohesive workflow.

If you're looking to enhance your DevOps skills, I highly recommend setting up a similar environment. Start small, iterate often, and don't be afraid to break things—that's how the best learning happens!

Happy automating! 🚀
