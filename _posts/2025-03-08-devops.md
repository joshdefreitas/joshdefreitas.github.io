# Creating My First Homelab: A Journey to Improving My Developer Skills

Building a homelab was a significant step in enhancing my skills as a developer, especially with the focus on cloud-native technologies and infrastructure management. This journey provided me with hands-on experience in server management, networking, virtualization, and remote connectivity. In this blog post, Iâ€™ll walk you through the steps I took to set up my homelab using an old laptop and later expanding it into a **Proxmox cluster** with a Dell OptiPlex.

---

## The Initial Setup: A Modest Beginning

My journey began with an old laptop that I had lying around. It wasnâ€™t a powerhouse by any means, but it had enough to get started. The laptop had:

- **8GB RAM**
- **256GB storage**
- **Intel i5 8th Gen processor**

Although these specs are far from ideal for heavy workloads, they were perfect for a beginner's homelab and a great way to experiment without investing too much upfront.

### Installing Proxmox

The first step was to turn my old laptop into a dedicated server by installing **Proxmox VE** (Virtual Environment). Proxmox is a powerful, open-source platform for managing virtual machines (VMs) and containers. Here's how I went about the installation:

1. **Creating a Bootable USB:**  
   I downloaded the Proxmox ISO image and created a bootable USB using a tool like Rufus.

2. **Installing Proxmox:**  
   I booted the laptop from the USB and followed the installation prompts. Soon, I had Proxmox running on my laptop.

3. **Configuring Interfaces:**  
   After installation, I configured the network interfaces. My router's **DHCP range was from 192.168.1.64 to 192.168.1.253**. To keep the Proxmox server accessible, I set the **gateway IP outside this range**, but still within my home network's subnet (e.g., **192.168.1.10**).

## Networking Challenges: WiFi Woes and the Solution

At first, I attempted to connect the laptop over WiFi, but I quickly ran into issues. Proxmox doesnâ€™t work well with WiFi interfaces when it comes to bridging, and the network setup was unstable.

### A Wired Solution

I decided to invest in a **Gigabit to USB adapter**. This gave me a wired Ethernet connection, which was a major improvement over WiFi. I connected the adapter to a **network switch**, which in turn was connected to my ISP router. This setup provided a **stable and fast connection**, ensuring that Proxmox could run without issues and that my virtual machines could communicate with each other and the outside world.

## Setting Up Virtualization: Ubuntu VMs and Templates

Once the networking was sorted out, I moved on to setting up virtual machines. I wanted to create a basic Ubuntu server VM to simulate real-world environments for development and testing.

1. **Uploading Ubuntu Server Images:**  
   I downloaded the latest Ubuntu Server ISO and uploaded it to Proxmox.

2. **Creating Templates:**  
   I also created a **template out of my Ubuntu VM**. This made it easy to spin up new instances whenever I needed to test different setups.

## Remote Access: SSH and Tailscale

To enable remote access, I installed **Tailscale** on the Proxmox server. This allowed me to **SSH into my Proxmox server from anywhere**, making remote management incredibly easy.

## Expanding the Homelab: Adding a Dell OptiPlex

After running my homelab on a single node for a while, I decided to **expand it by adding a second node** to create a Proxmox cluster. I acquired a **Dell OptiPlex**, which had better hardware than my laptop:

- **16GB RAM**
- **500GB storage**
- **Intel i5 7th Gen processor**

### Installing Proxmox on the Dell OptiPlex

The installation process for Proxmox was **exactly the same** as with the laptop. I followed these steps:

1. Created a **bootable USB with the Proxmox ISO**
2. Installed **Proxmox VE**
3. Configured **network settings** similar to my first node

### Creating a Proxmox Cluster

Once the Dell OptiPlex was running Proxmox, I proceeded to **join it to my existing Proxmox installation** on the laptop to form a **Proxmox cluster**. Hereâ€™s how I did it:

1. **Created a Cluster on the First Node (Laptop)**

   - In the Proxmox web UI, I navigated to **Datacenter â†’ Cluster** and created a new cluster.

2. **Joined the Dell OptiPlex to the Cluster**

   - On the second node (OptiPlex), I ran the join command provided by Proxmox.

3. **Verified Cluster Status**
   - After successfully adding the node, I confirmed that both machines were part of the same cluster in the **Proxmox UI**.

Now, I had a **multi-node Proxmox homelab** capable of **migrating VMs** between nodes and providing a **more scalable environment** for experimentation.

## Lessons Learned and Future Expansions

This homelab setup has already taught me a great deal about networking, server management, and virtualization. Here are some of the key takeaways:

- **Proxmox and Networking:** I learned the importance of using a **wired connection** for stability.
- **VM Management:** Setting up **templates for VMs** makes deployment much faster.
- **Remote Access:** **Tailscale** is a game-changer for secure and easy remote access.
- **Cluster Management:** Running a **multi-node Proxmox cluster** allows for VM **migration and load balancing**.

### Future Expansions

Now that I have a **two-node Proxmox cluster**, I plan to expand my homelab even further. Some of my next goals include:

- **Adding More Nodes:** Increasing the number of machines in my cluster for even more scalability.
- **Exploring Kubernetes:** Running **K3s** or **Kubernetes clusters** on top of my VMs.
- **Automating Deployments:** Using **Ansible and Terraform** for infrastructure automation.

## Conclusion

Building my first homelab and later expanding it into a **multi-node cluster** was an incredibly rewarding experience. It gave me a deeper understanding of **server management, networking, and virtualization**, all of which are crucial skills for modern cloud engineering.

With my **two-node Proxmox cluster** in place, I feel more confident experimenting with **new cloud-native technologies**, running **containers, Kubernetes, and automation tools**, and ultimately improving my skills as a **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)**.

Stay tuned for future updates as I continue to grow my homelab and take on more advanced projects! ðŸš€
