# Creating My First Homelab: A Journey to Improving My Developer Skills

Building a homelab was a significant step in enhancing my skills as a developer, especially with the focus on cloud-native technologies and infrastructure management. This journey provided me with hands-on experience in server management, networking, virtualization, and remote connectivity. In this blog post, I’ll walk you through the steps I took to set up my homelab using an old laptop and the lessons I learned along the way.

## The Setup: A Modest Beginning

My journey began with an old laptop that I had lying around. It wasn’t a powerhouse by any means, but it had enough to get started. The laptop had:

- **8GB RAM**
- **256GB storage**
- **Intel i5 8th Gen processor**

Although these specs are far from ideal for heavy workloads, they were perfect for a beginner's homelab and a great way to experiment without investing too much upfront.

### Installing Proxmox

The first step was to turn my old laptop into a dedicated server by installing **Proxmox VE** (Virtual Environment). Proxmox is a powerful, open-source platform for managing virtual machines (VMs) and containers. Here's how I went about the installation:

1. **Creating a Bootable USB:**  
   I downloaded the Proxmox ISO image and created a bootable USB using a tool like Rufus. This was relatively straightforward and helped me quickly get Proxmox onto the laptop.

2. **Installing Proxmox:**  
   I booted the laptop from the USB and followed the installation prompts. The process was smooth, and soon, I had Proxmox running on my laptop.

3. **Configuring Interfaces:**  
   After installation, I moved on to configuring the network interfaces. I wanted the laptop to be part of my home network, so I needed to ensure it was set up with a static IP address. I learned that my router's DHCP range was from **192.168.1.64 to 192.168.1.253**. To keep the Proxmox server accessible, I set the gateway IP outside this range, but still within my home network's subnet (e.g., **192.168.1.10**).

## Networking Challenges: Wifi Woes and the Solution

At first, I attempted to connect the laptop over WiFi, but I quickly ran into issues. Proxmox doesn’t work well with WiFi interfaces when it comes to bridging, and the network setup was unstable. This taught me a valuable lesson in network configurations and the limitations of using wireless connections for server environments.

### A Wired Solution

I decided to invest in a **Gigabit to USB adapter**. This gave me a wired Ethernet connection, which was a major improvement over WiFi. I connected the adapter to a **network switch**, which in turn was connected to my ISP router. This setup provided a stable and fast connection, ensuring that Proxmox could run without issues and that my virtual machines could communicate with each other and the outside world.

## Setting Up Virtualization: Ubuntu VMs and Templates

Once the networking was sorted out, I moved on to setting up virtual machines. I wanted to create a basic Ubuntu server VM to simulate real-world environments for development and testing.

1. **Uploading Ubuntu Server Images:**  
   I downloaded the latest Ubuntu Server ISO and uploaded it to Proxmox. This allowed me to create a new VM using the image.

2. **Creating Templates:**  
   I also took the time to create a template out of my Ubuntu VM. This made it easy to spin up new instances of the same configuration whenever I needed to test different setups or install new software. Proxmox's template system is a real time-saver!

## Remote Access: SSH and Tailscale

As someone who is constantly on the move, I needed a way to remotely access my homelab. After some research, I decided to install **Tailscale** on the Proxmox server. Tailscale is a zero-config VPN service that creates a secure network between devices, making it easy to access your devices from anywhere.

### Why Tailscale?

- **Easy to set up:** It only took a few minutes to get it running.
- **Remote SSH access:** With Tailscale, I could SSH into my Proxmox server from anywhere, making it super convenient for development and troubleshooting.

Once Tailscale was up and running, I was able to securely access my homelab from my phone, laptop, or anywhere else.

## Lessons Learned and Future Expansions

This homelab setup has already taught me a great deal about networking, server management, and virtualization. Here are some of the key takeaways:

- **Proxmox and Networking:** I learned the importance of using a wired connection for stability, especially when using virtualized environments.
- **VM Management:** Setting up templates for VMs is an incredibly efficient way to manage multiple environments with minimal effort.
- **Remote Access:** Tailscale was a game-changer for secure and easy remote access, something I will continue to use in the future.

### Future Expansions

As I continue to build on this homelab, I plan to expand it further. One of the next steps will be adding a second cluster to increase scalability and allow for more complex setups. This will also give me more experience with clustering technologies and distributed systems.

## Conclusion

Building my first homelab was an incredibly rewarding experience. It not only gave me a deeper understanding of server management, but it also pushed me to learn about networking, virtualization, and remote access tools. With this new setup, I feel more confident in my skills as a developer and more prepared to tackle more advanced cloud and infrastructure projects in the future.
