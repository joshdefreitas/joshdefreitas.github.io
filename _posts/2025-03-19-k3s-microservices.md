# Building a Kubernetes-Based Microservices Platform

## Introduction

As part of my journey into cloud-native development and site reliability engineering (SRE), I built a Kubernetes-based microservices platform. This project focused on container orchestration, service discovery, traffic management, observability, and resilience engineering. The key components included:

- A multi-node Kubernetes cluster (k3s/k8s)
- A service mesh (Istio/Linkerd)
- An observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry)
- Automated CI/CD pipelines (ArgoCD, Flux, or Tekton)
- Chaos engineering experiments (Chaos Mesh/Litmus)

This blog post outlines the architecture, implementation, and key learnings from this project.

## Architecture Overview

Architecture Overview

The platform follows a cloud-native microservices architecture. Hereâ€™s a high-level breakdown:

- **Kubernetes Cluster:** A multi-node cluster running k3s/k8s to manage containerized applications.
- **Service Mesh:** Istio or Linkerd handles service-to-service communication, traffic management, and security policies.
- **Observability:** Prometheus and Grafana provide real-time metrics.
- **CI/CD Automation:** ArgoCD/Flux automates application deployment and updates.
- **Chaos Engineering:** Chaos Mesh or Litmus tests system resilience by injecting controlled failures.
